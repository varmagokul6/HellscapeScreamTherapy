# HellscapeScreamTherapy


Submission for OakHacks 2020

### Inspiration
The amount of stress we get as college student is infinite; with the amount of work and studying we have to do every day, there are times during the day where we just want to scream in hopes that all our stress just flies out. If anything, we wanted to create a stress relief app with a unique twist.

### The Process

We split the tasks into separate sections:

1. Voice Capture - How would we capture the voice of the user and use that for game play?
2. Animation - How would we animate the game itself?


**Voice Capture**

To get the player's voice, we used the Microphone and Audio Clip modules, which enabled us to sample the voices. Since the microphone was constantly on, we took the highest decibel value per frame. Based on the decibel level, we were able to determine how much damage the monster would take.

**Animation**

We used 2D pixel art because we thought it to be simpler to implement and we had more experience in general working with them. Aseprite was used to create the sprites and rig some basic animations for the main character and the monster. The sprites were then transferred to Unity and given the appropriate C# scripts according to their intended behavior. We also edited some of the free Unity tile assets to be more in line with our aesthetic and utilized some free music from the Unity website as well. We really wanted to create that feeling of being in a dark place and the catharsis that just comes out when letting out a good-hearted scream. 

### What Did We Learn?

We learned how to use Unity; Unity was something some of us had never touched before, and getting accustomed with that and learning how to program in C# was really challenging. However, it was a really fun experience, and we were able to create a game out of it.
